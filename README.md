# GFD-Written-Solutions
This document contains the erreta and some solutions to the GFD Written Exam at NYU Courant. The exams are in the "Problem\_packages" folder and is available by request from the department. PDE of the solution is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUx3hcL0IOHWuUP0YWinXTA-_gn1kcmq/view?usp=sharing).

Read Chapter 2 - Erreta before doing the problems might save you some time and pain. It contains the (possible) errors of the problems. 

The rest of the documents are (extended or terse) answers for some the problems in the written exam.

There most definitely will be errors so be mindful when you read the solutions. When you find any, please let me know at ryan_sjdu@nyu.edu. 

If you have also typed up solutions, I am happy to include yours in this document (with acknowledgement), or let my solutions be a part of your document. The goal is for there to be close to full solutions to all problems. 

I had help from Professor Olivier Pauluis, who taught me GFD, the solutions produced by past GFD students, and my 2020 peers.
